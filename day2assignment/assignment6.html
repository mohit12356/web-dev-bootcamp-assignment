		<p>Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger; Sanger coined its name as a portmanteau of "wiki" and "encyclopedia".[6][7] Initially available only in English, versions in other languages were quickly developed. The English Wikipedia, <span style="color: yellow;">with 6.3 million articles as of June 2021, is the largest of the 321 language editions</span>. Combined, Wikipedia's editions comprise more than 56 million articles, and attract more than 17 million edits and more than 1.7 billion unique visitors per month</p>
